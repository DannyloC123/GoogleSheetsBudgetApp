This is just a simple website to track spending and expenses. Not completely sure where I want to go with this, at first I just kept the expenses vs. income page. But later started adding some more stuff. I will continue to add more features when possible.

I am using a google sheet API to store the data as well as some Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to breakdown and annlyze the data. Then I would use Flask and html/css to create the web pages.

This is just a beginner project I am doing to get familiar with gathering data, anaylizing it, and then presenting it on a website.

I have completed the project, with just a home, income and expenses page. As I stated before I might come back to this to add some more features, but for now I want to explore other projects.


Just some notes for me in the future, some possible additions:
- a further breakdown of the expenses
    - maybe add a bar chart showing which categories are being spent on the most
- maybe add a savings/investment page similar to the goals page I had before
